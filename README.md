# DataAnalysis
Bike Rentals - Final Project Data Analytics is the culmination of the "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course on Dicoding, focusing on analyzing and creating a dashboard from a bike-sharing dataset. The notebook file provides a detailed walkthrough of the analysis process, covering Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. Additionally, a Streamlit-based dashboard has been developed for a user-friendly interface, accessible through [this link]( https://dataanalysisbyaghni.streamlit.app)

**Project Work Cycle:**
1. **Data Wrangling:**
   - Gathering data
   - Assessing data
   - Cleaning data

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Defined business questions for data exploration
   - Create Data exploration

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Create Data Visualization that answers business questions

4. **Dashboard:**
   - Set up the DataFrame for use
   - Create filter components on the dashboard
   - Complete the dashboard with various data visualizations

**Getting Started:**
1. ### `notebook.ipynb`
   - Download the project.
   - Open your favorite IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory.
   - Create a new notebook.
   - Upload and select the file with a .ipynb extension.
   - Connect to a hosted runtime.
   - Run the code cells.

2. ### `dashboard/dashboard.py`
   - Download the project.
   - Install Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt using `pip install streamlit`. Install other libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn if not already installed.
   - Keep the csv file in the same folder as dashboard.py as it acts as a data source.
   - Open your VSCode and run the file by clicking the terminal and writing `streamlit run dashboard.py`.

**Screenshots:**
- Screenshots of the dashboard are available in the screenshots directory.
